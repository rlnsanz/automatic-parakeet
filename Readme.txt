[Description]

This is a set of well controlled and parameterized fork bomb program as test case for our operating system course project.



[Usage]

#fork_loop n

The program generates a certain amount of children by fork, then goes into infinite loop. The forked children does not fork any more.

n is the number of children it generates.


#fork_long_tail n

The program generates 1 child by fork, then goes into infinite loop. The generated children has exactly the same behavior as its parent, i.e. generate 1 child by fork then loops forever. The decendant stops generating child after a certain generation.

n is the number of generation (i.e. decendant level) it generates.


#fork_binary n

The program generates 2 children by fork, then goes into infinite loop. The generated children has exactly the same behavior as its parent, i.e. generate 2 children by fork then loops forever. The decendant stops generating child after a certain generation.

n is the number of generation (i.e. decendant level) it generates.


#fork_stochastic seed max n

The program randomly generates at most (max - 1) children by fork, then goes into infinite loop. The generated children has exactly the same behavior as its parent, i.e. randomly generates at most (max - 1) children then loops forever. The decendant stops generating child after a certain generation.

seed is the initial seed for random generator.
max is the maximum number of children generated by one process
n is the number of generation (i.e. decendant level) it generates.


#fork_bomb

The program forks indefinitely. The forked children has exactly the same behavior as its parent, i.e. forks indefinitely.
